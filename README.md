## About the Project

KnowQuiz is a web application that supports effective learning through a flashcard system generated with the help of artificial intelligence. The application allows users to create topics and lessons, automatically generate flashcard content based on user questions, and then learn using an algorithm that takes spaced repetition into account. The product uses OpenAI API both to generate answers to questions created by the user and to evaluate the correctness of answers provided during learning sessions.

### Key Features
- AI-generated flashcards from user questions
- Structured organization with topics and lessons
- Intelligent spaced repetition system
- Voice recognition and text-to-speech capabilities
- Support for both Polish and English languages
